        I am a graduate studnet at the University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.
        My major is Data Science, and minor is Computer Science. My undergraduate major is Material Science Engineering.
        But I find myself interested in computer science. I feel self-satisfied when I completed a project with my
        teammates or by myself. The field I want to go deeper in is web development.

        <li>From September, 2021 to now, I study at <strong><a href="https://www.uzh.ch/de.html">University of
                    Zurich</a></strong> for the master's degree. My major is
            data science, and minor is computer science. During study, I learned software construction, and designed a
            "A Checkers Game" application and
            "A Blackjack Game" application using java with teammates. Through foundations of data science, my companion
            and I completed three data-analysis projects
            using numpy with keras, tensorflow, pandas and so on. I also learned data structure and database system. Now
            I am working on my own project,
            which is about hotel-reservation application.</li>

                    University of Technology</a>, Guangzhou, China</strong>. I studied material science
            engineering, including materials science, mechanical engineering and auto-control. From 2020 to 2021, I did
            the research assisstant at my department,
            mainly focusing on materials' self-healing properties.</li>
